# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
get distinct fullvisitorid's, and productsku to join other columns/tables
-created views with clean filtered data



## Process
### Analyze the data in raw form
- identifying primary key to join tables ( using productsku and fullvisiotorid )
Clean data by removing null values or (not set)
- using where clause to filter values like (not set) or null

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
Using null values and joins can filter out missing data and return non null values


## Challenges 
Alot of missing values in columns, not every visitor made a purchase. using fvid and productsku's really helped with that.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
If I had more time, id like to include question 4 with a excel distribution chart based on distinct category names and units_sold from analytics table. 
I think it be a nice visual representation.
Also a distribution chart with country and units_sold
