# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### Created alot of view tables, used them to isolate the extact column I would need
### Shortening the fvid (fullvisitorid) Looks nicer when there is not 0000000 or other numbers involved. the first 6 is the "unique" identifier.
### using fvid and productsku's as PK to join the views

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
alot of missing data, so I had to use what was available based on PK's such as fvid (fullvisitorid) I shortened it to the first 6 digits.


## Challenges 
Alot of missing values in columns, not every visitor made a purchase. using fvid and productsku's really helped with that.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
If I had more time, id like to include question 4 with a excel distribution chart based on distinct category names and units_sold from analytics table. 
I think it be a nice visual representation.
Also a distribution chart with country and units_sold

CLEAN MORE OF IT.

More answers to questions such as
avg time spent before purchase
conversion % (total visitors to site that ended up purchasing)
