What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

I think its important to have the data clean.
There are many instances where values are (not set) ie city, and totaltransactionrevenue were null's

Im guessing it could be that not every visitor made a purchase

I was worried about inconsistent data from different tables not matching up or having null values



QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.

i used alot of where clause is not to remove (not set) from city, and is not null for the nulls

also paid alot of attention to the total results, using that to match up with other results or rows
